            Hello! I’m Chaitanya Datta, a Computer Science undergraduate at VIT Vellore, 
            passionate about programming, problem-solving, and exploring new technologies. 
            I have been developing my skills in Java, Python, C, and C++, along with the fundamentals 
            of web development, and I enjoy applying my knowledge through practical projects and exercises. 
            Through my studies, I have gained a strong foundation in software concepts, algorithms, 
            and data structures, which I consistently practice and implement in small projects and challenges. 
            I am motivated by opportunities to learn new technologies and apply them creatively, 
            whether in building web applications, writing scripts, or solving coding problems.

        <p>
            I take a hands-on approach to learning, combining technical knowledge with creativity to design and implement solutions effectively. 
            My focus is on strengthening my programming skills, building a solid foundation in software development, 
            and gaining experience that prepares me for future opportunities in the tech industry. 
            I enjoy breaking down complex problems into manageable steps and experimenting with different approaches 
            to find efficient solutions. Additionally, I actively participate in coding exercises, online challenges, 
            and collaborative projects, which help me improve teamwork, adaptability, and real-world problem-solving skills.

        <p>
            Outside of academics and coding, I engage in activities that support creativity and personal growth. 
            I enjoy reading books on fiction, technology, and self-development, and listening to music while studying. 
            I also participate in coding challenges and hackathons, which help me think critically and apply programming skills. 
            These hobbies keep me motivated, balanced, and continuously learning.
